# Machine Learning Portfolio
This section will store all of my files related to machine learning. It will include not only algorithms and their implementations but also walkthroughs of my thought processes. The aim is to map out my progress in programming, machine learning (ML), data structures and algorithms (DSA), and more, to build deeper knowledge over time.

One of my primary goals is to understand machine learning algorithms and the mathematics/processes behind them. To achieve this, I will attempt to create algorithms from scratch in addition to using pre-existing models from packages like sklearn, TensorFlow, and others.
